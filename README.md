Django-Rest-framework-XMLRender-without-root-tag
================================================

This python CustomXMLRenderer will render XML without the root tag .


What was the problem ?

The root tag was added in the default XMLRenderer. 

How I solved it ?

CustomXMLRenderer removes it by overriding render method in XMLRenderer class .
